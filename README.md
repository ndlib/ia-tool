# Hesburgh Libraries Internet Archive Script

This is a Python program for uploading Hesburgh Libraries content to the Internet Archive. Instructions for running the program, including information about installing necessary packages, are available in the main `ia-uploader.ipynb` file.

`template.csv` is an empty spreadsheet that contains the column headers for the metadata needed to ingest materials.
